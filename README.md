DATASET DESCRIPTION: 

This Dataset is intended for public access and use. The purpose of this data collection is to gather Federally-managed datasets relevant to the health of older adults in and outside the context of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Older adults reside at the intersection of key demographic and health challenges, including those resulting from the pandemic. Insights from data on the older adult population – before, during, and after COVID-19 – is also needed to better understand the impact of the pandemic on the health of this growing population segment.
